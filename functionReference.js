// Every type of function
// Practice and examples

// The following functions writen as a function declarations

// 1st func that accepts a callback
function functionRunner(callback) {
  callback();
}
// 2nd func we will use as the callback
function log() {
  console.log('Hello World!');
}
// 1st func called with the 2nd func acting as callback
functionRunner(log);

// The following function does the same as above but the callback is writen as an annonomys function

// 1st func called with annonomys func acting as callback
functionRunner(() => console.log('Hello World!'));
// With es6 syntax you can reduce the code above to look like the following line
functionRunner(console.log('Hello World!'));
